//
// It drives the workload by adding and removing placements rather than by
// moving an existing placement's minReplicas: a change to minReplicas on a
// placement that already exists is not currently acted on, while a new
// placement is picked up within seconds.
//
// A replica that has just taken the fleet has no change of its own to space
// from, so leadership itself starts the interval: the first change comes one
// full Interval after this replica started leading, not within seconds of a
// rollout. Because leadership is only ever observed on a tick, that moment is
// always at or after the process started.
//
// Every replica runs this code, so one of them has to be chosen. The choice is
// made from what discovery already reports — the oldest running Instance drives
// — and is re-made on every tick. Two replicas briefly agreeing they
// both lead is harmless: an action writes a desired shape, and writing the
// same shape twice is the same as writing it once.
