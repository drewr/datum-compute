/**
 * The vocabulary the two halves of the walkthrough share.
 *
 * The demo explains itself in two phases, and they want opposite controls:
 *
 * - The **intro** (intro.ts) is a short fixed sequence of hand-written cards
 *   captioning a picture that is not changing. Nothing is happening, so the
 *   visitor may page through it: Back, Next and a progress ring.
 * - The **narration** (narration.ts) takes over when the intro finishes, and
 *   raises a card each time the workload actually does something. There is no
 *   paging through that — a scale-up cannot be rewound, and a card for one
 *   would describe a map that has moved on.
 *
 * Keeping them in separate modules keeps the seam obvious: narration reads
 * only what the fleet view reports, so the day those events come from a real
 * workload rather than a simulated one, nothing in the intro has to change.
 *
 * Neither half ever commands the fleet. One process serves every viewer, so a
 * cue from one browser would move the world for everyone else watching.
