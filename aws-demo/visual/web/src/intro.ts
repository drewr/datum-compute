 * The intro: four hand-written cards that say what the visitor is looking at.
 *
 * Nothing is happening while they show — the map is a picture and these are
 * its captions — so the visitor may page through them. That is the whole
 * reason this half has Back and Next and the narration half does not.
 *
 * The words are written here; the numbers in them are read off the fleet as
 * the card shows, so the copy and the screen cannot drift apart. The cards
 * also carry the camera: the sequence opens on the whole fleet and ends inside
 * one location, close enough that its Instances fan out and can be counted.
